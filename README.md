The client was a business owner who wanted to give the learning drivers in his area a place to learn the rules of the road plus get some in person driving experience before taking their test and getting their license. They wanted to design an online system that would give the students access to different packages that opened them up to things such as courses and in person learning. They also wanted the system to have a scheduling system that could be accessed by the secretary or by the student. 
I think I grasped the concept of understanding what the customer wanted and laying it out. I think I just needed to give more time to learning how to design the diagrams. 
I tried to focus on the points the owner made that he wanted such as an accessible scheduling system and a system that reported when changes were made. The userâ€™s needs are important because the system is being designed for them and to be used by their customers. 
I approach designing software by listening to what the customer wants and asking questions based on what they have said. I like to design and test at their proper stages until the system works nearly flawlessly. In the future I will make sure to focus not only on what the customer wants but how that will play into what my team has to do in each step.
